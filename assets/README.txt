# Asset Requirements

This directory should contain the following assets:

## Models
- `models/player.glb`: Player character model (LEGO-style)
- `models/enemy.glb`: Enemy character model (LEGO-style)
- `models/m1_garand.glb`: M1 Garand rifle model
- `models/building1.glb`: Building model 1
- `models/building2.glb`: Building model 2

## Textures
- `textures/ground.jpg`: Ground/terrain texture
- `textures/sky.jpg`: Sky/skybox texture

## Sounds
- `sounds/gunshot.mp3`: Gunshot sound effect
- `sounds/reload.mp3`: Weapon reload sound effect
- `sounds/hit.mp3`: Hit/impact sound effect

You can create or obtain these assets from various sources:
1. Create them using 3D modeling software like Blender
2. Download free assets from sites like Sketchfab, TurboSquid, or Free3D
3. Use asset packs from the Unity Asset Store or Unreal Marketplace (check licenses)
4. Generate them using AI tools or procedural generation

For placeholder purposes, you can use simple geometric shapes and basic textures until proper assets are available.
